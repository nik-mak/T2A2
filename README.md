# T2A2 - Marketplace Project - Nerd Bucket

## R7 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
The problem this site aims to solve is making it easier for the general public and new/junior devs to connect with established developers and to work together on a project. 

## R8 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?
People can often find it tiresome or intimidating to find established developers and end up deciding to forego contacting anyone. This barrier to discovering developers has prevented many people from discovering talent and what the world of programming looks like. By having a site like this, it allows for the general public to peirce the bubble that encapsulates the world of software developers. It allows the general public to peer into this world and see what goes on under the hood many of the sites/applications that they use on a daily basis. 

This barrier has also prevented new and upcoming developers from learning about the processes involved in creating such programs. While traditional education can teach someone how to write a method or function, it is often the case that most new developers don't get exposed to the developmental process involved until they get a job in the field.
